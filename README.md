# Job Change Calculator
### Overview
Do you want or need to change your current job? Have you ever wondered how it might affect your salary? With this app, you can easily calculate the financial impact of a job change on your future salary and visualize the results.

Enter the number of years until your retirement, your current and new salary, and the expected annual salary increase rate. Optionally, you can enter a compensation payment from your current employer. You can choose an amount of money to withdraw from the compensation payment each year, for example, to offset a lower salary in your new job. You can also calculate the investment returns from your compensation payment.


Parameter:
* Years until retirement
* Current job salary (k€/year)
* New job salary (k€/year)
* Expected annual salary increase rate (%)
* Compensation payment (k€)
* Annual payout from compensation payment (k€/year)
* Expected annual return from compensation payment investment (%)

Finally, you can export the detailed calculation as a csv file.
